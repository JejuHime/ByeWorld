# ByeWorld
First project
Hello, World. It annoys me that no one includes a comma there. Anyway, I'm an English teacher hoping and praying and studying to become a web dev, probably front end as I find Javascript interesting enough to dive deep into it. But who knows. I'm currently taking a JS course, and I need to figure out what my next move will be. I am happy to be here and I am counting the days until I can quit teaching and get my first web dev opportunity! #blackgirlscode
